## Snapshot testing

- Using a library to pre-render our react code, and then compare that in formation with a rest renderer. 
- Testing the state of your components.
- "When this is clicked, this should render on the screen."
- Testing your front-end.


`npm install react-scripts react react-dom` (do not need to install jest because react-scripts does that for us)
`npm install enzyme react-test-renderer enzyme-adapter-react-16`
